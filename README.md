# Asst2: Segmented Paging

## Phase A: Direct-Mapped Memory

The "main memory", "RAM", or "pysical memory" is a `char` array referenced by `memory` of size `MEM_SIZE` where all bytes are initialized to `0`. The first `sizeof(struct memoryMetadata)` bytes is metadata. The first `sizeof(int)` bytes tell if the memory has been initialized. The rest of the metadata gives information on the "partitions" used by the thread library and threads.

A "partition" is a chunk of memory that consists of atleast one "block" of memory. If there is more than one "block" in a partition, the "blocks" must be contiguous.

A "block" is a chunk of memory that consists of "head" metadata, a "payload", and "tail" metadata. "Head" and "tail" metadata are the same except "head" metadata resides in the first `sizeof(struct blockMetadata)` bytes of the "block" and "tail" metadata resides in the last `sizeof(sturct blockMetadata)` bytes. The "payload" resides inbetween the "head" and "tail" metadata. The first `sizeof(int)` bytes of the "head" and "tail" metadata tell if the "block" is used, and the rest of the meatadata tells the size of the payload.

### `myallocate`

When called, `myallocate` first checks if `memory` is initialized. If not, `memory` is initialized by setting the metadata and "partitions" for the thread library and threads according to `LIBRARY_MEMORY_WEIGHT` and `THREADS_MEMORY_WEIGHT`. `myallocate` allocates the requested size of memory in the requested "partition" using a first-fit algorithm.

### `mydeallocate`

When called, `mydeallocate` first checks if `ptr` is in the requested "parition". If it is, `mydeallocate` sets the corresponding "block" to free and coalesces with imediate neighboring "blocks" if they are free.
